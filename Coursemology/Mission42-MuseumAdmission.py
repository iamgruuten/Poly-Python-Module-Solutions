#   Price of Museum Tickets   #
###############################

#Background
#==========
#Admission to Singapore museums is free for Singapore citizens (SC) and permanent residents (PR). 
#All others will have to pay $15 per entry.

#Write a Python program to calculate the price of tickets for a group of visitors consisting
#of SC, PR and others.
#
#The program is to prompt user for the total number visitors and the number of SCs and PRs
#calculate the total cost of the tickets,
#and display this cost.

#Important Notes
#===============
#1) Comment out ALL input prompts before submitting.
#2) You MUST use the following variables
#   - total_no_visitors
#   - num_SCandPR
#   - total_cost
#   - num_others

#START CODING FROM HERE
#======================

#  Prompt and accept data from user.
total_no_visitors = int(input("Enter the amount of visitors: "))
num_SCandPR = int(input("Enter the number of SCs and PRs: "))

#Calculate Ticket Cost
def calculate_cost(total_no_visitors, num_SCandPR):

    if (total_no_visitors - num_SCandPR) != 0:        #Check number of other visitors
        num_others = total_no_visitors - num_SCandPR
        total_cost = num_others * 15    #calculate total price of tickets
        print("The total price of tickets is ${}".format(total_cost)) #Modify to display total price of tickets
    else:
        total_cost = 0#calculate total price of tickets
        print("Admission is free for ALL") #Modify to display that Admission is free for all        
    return total_cost #Do not remove this line

    
#Do not remove the next line
calculate_cost(total_no_visitors, num_SCandPR) 

#input 75,50 output 375
#input 75,75 output 0
